The purpose was to display all (256)^3 colours on a 4096-by-4096 pixel image.
I quickly came up with an algorithm for it and below was one of the results:

Unfortunately looking back at the code, I've realized that my coding practices then were not the best, so I decided to start the project from scratch again.
